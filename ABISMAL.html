			<h3>About This Project</h3>	

			<p>ABISMAL stands for 'A Big Informational Site Management Algorithm' and does exactly what its name suggests. It automates the updating of a website's navbar and metadata whenever a new page is created. Thus it allows the website admin to focus purely on updating the site's content rather than spending 20 minutes updating the navbar on every page or having to copy and edit a template for the page's metadata.</p>
			<p>It exists in the form of a configurable compilation script, to update the website all one has to do is run the script. Pages can be created by writing bare html content (no DOCTYPE or head or body section, all that is created by the script!).</p>

			<p>The image above is a website managed with ABISMAL. It is using the stock CSS template and no other configuration. The pages in the navbar are placed in order of creation date.</p>
			<p>For reference, this is a text editor split between the code which I had to write for this website (on the right) and the code that was automatically compiled by the program (on the left). Notice the many links that were created for the navigation bar, in a manually created website, should you add another page, those links would have to be updated across all the existing pages!</p>

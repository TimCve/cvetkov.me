			<h3 id="section1">Section 1 - Registering & Logging In</h3>
			<p>In order for the other sections to be applicable to you, you must either log into an existing account or register a new account in the system. In order to register, access the registration form <a href="#fig1-user">[Fig. 1]</a>, via. the link located on the initial login page.</p>

			<center class="img-container">
				<a href="./images/fig1-user.png"><img src="./images/fig1-user.png" id="fig1-user"></a>
				<br>
				<label>Fig. 1 - The registration form</label>
			</center>

			<p>
				The form will prompt you for the following details:
				<ul>
					<li>Full name</li>
					<li>E-mail address</li>
					<li>Your department</li>
					<li>Your position</li>
					<li>Password (and confirm the password)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Once those details are entered into the registration form and there are no conflicts, you will be automatically logged into the system.
			</p>

			<h3 id="section2">Section 2 - Main Interface</h3>
			<p>The main interface for every user consists of a calendar <a href="#fig2-user">[Fig. 2]</a>. The calendar can be seeked through using the arrow buttons at the top, or by manually typing the month and year into the appropriate fields.</p>
			<p>
				If a day has reservations made for it, they will be displayed as multi-coloured icons.
				<ul>
					<li>Green: The reservation was made by you and is confirmed.</li>
					<li>Blue: You were invited to the reservation and it is confirmed.</li>
					<li>Yellow: The reservation is not confirmed.</li>
					<li>Red: You are not invited to this reservation.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>The calendar shows all reservations that have been made in the system, so all users know exactly when every room is free/occupied.</p>

			<center class="img-container">

				<label>Fig. 2 - The main interface</label>
			</center>

			<p>It is possible to search through all your reservations by accessing the search interface <a href="#fig3-user">[Fig. 3]</a> using the button at the bottom of the calendar. The reservations will be filtered by date scheduled in ascending order (meaning the closest reservation will be first in the list). Inputting a search query will allow you to search by date, time or title of the reservation.</p>

			</center>

			<h3 id="section3">Section 3 - Day Menu</h3>
			<p>Clicking on a day in the calendar will bring up the menu for that day <a href="#fig4-user">[Fig. 4]</a>. In this menu, you will be able to see all reservations which have already been made for that day, including the ones you were invited to but didn't reserve yourself and the ones that you weren't invited to at all.</p>
			<p>This menu will allow you to cancel any reservations that you reserved yourself (you will be prompted for confirmation to prevent accidental cancellations).</p>
			<p>
				For any one reservation, you will be able to see:
				<ul>
					<li>The room it is scheduled in.</li>
					<li>The time it is scheduled for.</li>
					<li>The organiser's e-mail address.</li>
					<li>The e-mail addresses of everybody who was invited.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>There are 2 filters in this menu which allow to view reservations by room (dropdown in top left) or to only view reservations that you were/weren't invited to (dropdown in top right).</p>

			<p>The menu for a particular day (See <a href="#section3">Section 3</a> for details), also allows you to create a new reservation, begin by selecting 'New Reservation' at the bottom right of the pop-up window.

				<label>Fig. 5 - The reservation creation menu</label>
			</center>

			<p>
				The form will unlock new options as you enter the required details:
				<ul>
					<li>Select the room your reservation will take place in. After you've done that, a visualisation of the room's occupied times will appear, you cannot make a reservation that interferres with existing reservations, begins at the same time as another one ends or ends at the same time as another one begins.</li>
					<li>Once the room is selected, enter all other details (title, time interval, select invited people and/or type in e-mails manually (optional).</li>
					<li>Press 'Create reservation', if everything is in order the reservation will be recorded on your calendar and the calendars of every invited person (provided they are registered in the system).</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>Once the reservation has been made, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to you. Click the respective link at the bottom of that e-mail to either confirm or decline the reservation. The e-mail will be structured like this:</p>
			<div class="sample-output">
				<p>THIS IS AN E-MAIL SENT BY AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM</p>
				<hr>
				<p>A reservation has been created with your account.</p>
				<p style="margin-top: 1rem"><strong>Title: </strong>RESERVATION_TITLE</p>
				<p><strong>Room: </strong>ROOM</p>
				<p><strong>Date: </strong>XX/XX/XXXX</p>
				<p><strong>Time: </strong>XX:XX - XX:XX</p>

				<span style="margin-left: 10px; text-decoration: underline; color: #1371fd" href="#">Decline Reservation</span>
			</div>

			<p>

			<a style="margin-left: 20px" href="#user-features">/\ View features for users /\</a>

			<h3 id="section1">Section 1 - Managing Registered Users</h3>
			<p>Most administration is performed from the dedicated admin panel <a href="#fig1-user">[Fig. 1]</a> which appears in the navigation bar for administrators. The initial page on the admin panel is the 'Registered Users' table.</p>
			<p>This page allows the administrator to see what users are registered on the system and those users' details. Clicking on a user's e-mail address will automatically open your e-mail client and create an e-mail draft directed towards that user.</p>

			<center class="img-container">
				<a href="./images/fig1-admin.png"><img src="./images/fig1-admin.png" id="fig1-user"></a>
				<br>
				<label>Fig. 1 - The list of all registered users</label>
			</center>

			<p>Users can be removed with the 'Deregister' button, this action cannot be undone and requires confirmation to prevent accidental user deregistration. Users are not notified by e-mail if their account has been deregistered.</p>
			<p>An administrator can grant a non-admin administrator priveleges or remove administrator priveleges from another administrator. It is not possible to deregister an administrator or remove administrator priveleges from your own account.</p>

			<h3 id="section2">Section 2 - Managing Reservations</h3>
			<p>To open the reservation management interface, navigate to the 'All Reservations' page of the admin panel <a href="#fig2-user">[Fig. 2]</a>. This interface will allow you to see details about every single reservation that has been made through the system. Since this table may get very large, there are ways to filter & sort the content shown for easier administration.</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Reservations can be ordered by recency in 2 ways: 'time created' and 'time scheduled'. 'Time created' will allow you to see what reservations have been recently made, while 'time scheduled' will allow you to see what reservations will occur the soonest.</li>
					<li>It is also possible to only view reservations made with a particular e-mail address, or view reservations made by everyone (default).</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>Since a reservation may have a large amount of participants, the participants section is accessed through a separate interface <a href="#fig3-user">[Fig. 3]</a>, which can be toggled by pressing the 'Participants' button for a given reservation.</p>
			<p>If you cancel a reservation, the invited people will recieve an e-mail notification about the deletion of this reservation, the e-mail will be structured as follows:</p>
			<div class="sample-output">
				<p>THIS IS AN E-MAIL SENT BY AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM</p>
				<hr>
				<p>The following reservation that you have been invited to has been cancelled.</p>
				<p style="margin-top: 1rem"><strong>Title: </strong>RESERVATION_TITLE</p>
				<p><strong>Room: </strong>ROOM</p>
				<p><strong>Date: </strong>XX/XX/XXXX</p>
				<p><strong>Time: </strong>XX:XX - XX:XX</p>
				<p>Records of this reservation have been removed from your calendar.</p>
			</div>
			<p>The reservation will be erased from the calendars of every user in the system, no records of this reservation will remain.</p>

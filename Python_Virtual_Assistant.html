			<h3>About This Project</h3>	
			<p>This project is a desktop virtual assistant written in Python. It is activated and controlled entirely by voice commands, output is also given through voice synthesis. It makes use of numerous APIs from serices such as Wikipedia and YouTube.</p>
			<p>
			The following is a list all capabilities which have been implemented thus far:
			<ul>
				<li>'Repeat' command for echoing voice input given into the assistant.</li>
				<li>'Play' command which makes a call to the YouTube API to query for a song, the song is then played. (Every URL that has been played is saved in a file so repeated queries for the same song do not waste the API quota.)</li>
				<li>'Wikipedia' command that queries Wikipedia for the question that follows the command. The answer is then spoken with voice synthesis.</li>
				<li>'Execute' command which is able to run a custom shell script that was written by the user. This is a more advanced feature but also allows for easy programability and automation of desktop tasks using the voice assistant.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I have filmed a video demonstration of this project and that can be viewed on my YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qq-_rpcd_o" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qq-_rpcd_o</a></p>
			<p>Below is an image of the assistant running on my desktop and playing a song which I requested.</p>
